🎵 AI-Powered Song Video Creator & YouTube Uploader

This project automatically creates music videos based on a user-provided song file and uploads them to YouTube.
It uses AI-powered image generation, subtitles, lip-sync (Wav2Lip), and YouTube SEO optimization to make the final video engaging and optimized for reach.

✅ AI Image Generation (Gemini API) – Creates cinematic background images tailored to the song

✅ SEO-Optimized YouTube Titles – AI generates viral, click-worthy titles for uploads

✅ Auto Upload to YouTube – Videos are prepared in the correct format for easy uploading
